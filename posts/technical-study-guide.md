A collection of resources for learning more about data structures and algorithms along with other skills that relate to computer science, web development, machine learning, and whatever I feel compelled to learn about.

## Primary Resources

I'm hoping to be able to condense all the resources out there to just the high quality ones. These are note really limitations to this but just a way to have a starting point to dive into each subject. The goal is to make this immersive as possible and limit the amount of searching when trying to grasp a subject.

These resources are unfortunately not all free. To get the most out of my time I currently have subscriptions to <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Learning Platform</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Premium</a>.

### Books

### Podcast/Audio

- Base CS Podcast - need link

### Problem Practice

- <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>

## Data Structures and Algorithms

There will be a page dedicated to each subject. Some maybe be under the umbrella of other subjects but for now they will be listed individually on each page. As I go through these subjects it will giv eme a chance to gather the best content for each subject and hold it there for review.
